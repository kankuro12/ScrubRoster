**Customer portal:** Explicitly excluded  
**Status:** Authoritative build specification

---

# 0. Agent Operating Rules

Treat this document as the authoritative implementation contract.

1. Implement every requirement marked **MUST**.
2. Do not add customer-facing accounts, portals, booking, approval, notifications, or self-service features.
3. Build and stabilize the Laravel web application before beginning Ionic mobile development.
4. Build the Laravel API alongside the web modules so that the same domain services power both web and mobile.
5. Do not duplicate business logic between controllers, web pages, jobs, and API endpoints.
6. Use Laravel policies and permissions for every protected operation.
7. Add automated tests for every critical workflow.
8. Preserve audit history for task, attendance, property, GPS, assignment, evidence, and approval changes.
9. Never hard-delete operational records that are referenced by completed tasks, attendance, approvals, or audit entries.
10. Use database transactions for multi-record operations.
11. Use background jobs for notifications, image processing, geocoding retries, exports, and other slow operations.
12. Do not silently invent missing business requirements. Record unresolved decisions in `docs/decisions-pending.md`.
13. Keep the codebase modular and production-oriented. Do not deliver mock-only screens.
14. Every completed module must include:
    - database migrations;
    - models and relationships;
    - authorization;
    - validation;
    - domain services or actions;
    - web UI;
    - API endpoints where applicable;
    - tests;
    - audit logging;
    - seed or factory data;
    - documentation.

# 1. Product Definition

Build an internal workforce operations platform for a cleaning company.

The platform MUST manage:

- personnel;
- role-based access;
- teams and reporting lines;
- properties;
- property categories;
- property tags;
- task types;
- reusable task checklists;
- one-time and recurring tasks;
- assignment of tasks to individual staff or teams;
- shift scheduling;
- attendance;
- GPS-based check-in and check-out;
- task progress;
- photo evidence;
- completion remarks;
- supervisor or administrator approval;
- notifications;
- reports;
- audit history.

The platform MUST be delivered as:

1. a responsive Laravel web application;
2. a versioned Laravel API;
3. an Ionic mobile application for Android and iOS.

The web application MUST be built first.

---

# 2. Non-Negotiable Product Decisions

## 2.1 Internal Use Only

The application is for internal company personnel.

Allowed users:

- Super Administrator;
- Manager or Supervisor;
- Cleaner or Field Staff.

Do not implement:

- customer login;
- customer portal;
- customer booking;
- customer task tracking;
- customer approval;
- customer notifications;
- customer feedback portal;
- customer invoice access;
- customer self-service.

A property may contain optional contact details for operational use, but the contact is not an application user.

## 2.2 Property Fast Entry (Reimagined 2026-08-22)

For property creation, only the following fields are required:

- `name`;
- `address`.

Every other property field MUST be nullable or optional. This includes:

- category, tags, contact name/phone/email, postal_code;
- latitude, longitude, google_place_id, formatted_address;
- `needs_parking` (boolean), parking_instructions, access_instructions, safety_instructions;
- permitted_check_in_radius_meters, service_frequency, internal_notes, cleaning/billing fields;
- assigned manager/supervisor/cleaners/team/branch.

The property form MUST save with only name + address. Requirements do NOT live on property — they live on checklists (see §8).

Mobile-friendly: single-column on ≤576px, touch-friendly map (≥280px), 44px tap targets, collapsible optional section.

## 2.3 Leaflet + Coordinate Resolution (Reimagined)

Use **Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap + Nominatim** as primary map/geocode stack (Google Places remains optional fallback when `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` set, key stays server-side).

Required behavior:

1. User enters property name + address.
2. Address input offers autocomplete via Google Places when configured, otherwise plain text.
3. "Locate from address" button geocodes via backend Places proxy or direct Nominatim (`https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json`) — save general coordinate.
4. Leaflet map shows draggable pin; click map or drag pin to set **exact** coordinate; `Use my location` uses browser geolocation.
5. `latitude`/`longitude` are editable number inputs synced bidirectionally with pin (pin ↔ inputs ↔ label `lat,lng`).
6. If geocode returns no result, still allow save with only name+address; `geocode_status` → `pending`/`failed`, job `GeocodeProperty` retries with backoff.
7. Manual pin sets `location_source = manual_pin`, `geocode_status = manually_adjusted`.
8. Provide admin action to retry geocoding.
9. Do not block save when geocode unavailable.

`needs_parking` boolean: when true, parking_instructions + parking_fee become relevant; UI toggles fee field. Radius handling unchanged:

- `permitted_check_in_radius_meters` remains nullable; effective radius fallback: property → category → organization default → 150m system fallback. Stored per GPS event immutably.

## 2.4 Web First

Implement in this order:

1. Laravel foundation;
2. Laravel web administration and manager workflows;
3. Laravel API stabilization;
4. Ionic mobile application;
5. offline synchronization and advanced mobile behavior;
6. production hardening and deployment.

Do not begin full Ionic implementation before the web MVP acceptance criteria pass.

## 2.5 Shared Visual Style

The Laravel web application and Ionic mobile application MUST use the same visual language.

Create a shared design-token document containing:

- brand colors;
- semantic colors;
- typography scale;
- spacing scale;
- border radius;
- shadows;
- icons;
- form styles;
- button variants;
- status colors;
- task priority colors;
- attendance state colors;
- approval state colors.

Store the source tokens in a technology-neutral format such as JSON.

Generate or map those tokens to:

- Laravel web CSS variables;
- Ionic CSS variables.

The platforms do not need identical layouts, but they MUST look like the same product.

# 3. Required Technology Architecture

## 3.1 Laravel Backend and Web

Use Laravel for:

- server-rendered or hybrid web UI;
- authentication;
- authorization;
- REST API;
- validation;
- domain logic;
- queues;
- events;
- scheduled commands;
- notifications;
- audit logging;
- reports;
- exports;
- storage integration;
- real-time events.

Recommended Laravel web approach:

- Blade with Livewire and Alpine.js, or another Laravel-native interactive approach;
- Tailwind CSS or a consistent component system;
- Laravel session authentication for web;
- Laravel Sanctum for Ionic API authentication.

Do not place core business rules directly inside Blade components or controllers.

## 3.2 Ionic Mobile

Use Ionic with Capacitor for Android and iOS.

The Ionic application MUST support:

- authenticated API access;
- push notifications;
- camera capture;
- geolocation;
- local secure storage;
- offline task data;
- background synchronization where supported;
- calendar display;
- task status changes;
- attendance check-in and check-out;
- photo evidence upload;
- approval actions for authorized supervisors.

Choose one Ionic framework and use it consistently:

- Ionic Angular;
- Ionic React;
- Ionic Vue.

Document the choice in an architecture decision record.

## 3.3 Database

Use a relational database supported by Laravel.

Preferred:

- MySQL or MariaDB for compatibility with the existing Laravel operating environment.

Requirements:

- foreign keys;
- indexes on all search and relationship fields;
- spatially useful indexes where supported;
- soft deletion for configurable master records;
- immutable audit records;
- UTC timestamps in storage;
- organization timezone for presentation.

## 3.4 Infrastructure Services

Use:

- Redis for queues, cache, rate limits, locks, and optional real-time state;
- S3-compatible object storage for task images and documents;
- Laravel queue workers;
- Laravel scheduler;
- Google Maps Platform for Places and geocoding;
- Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android and cross-platform push coordination;
- Apple Push Notification Service through the selected push integration;
- Laravel Reverb, WebSockets, or a compatible real-time transport for live web updates.

# 7. Property Module

## 7.1 Property Data Contract

Create a `properties` table with fields equivalent to (reimagined — requirements removed, checklist-owned):

```text
id
uuid
name                                  NOT NULL
address                               NOT NULL
formatted_address                     NULL
google_place_id                       NULL   # optional when Google configured
latitude                              NULL   # Leaflet pin exact OR Nominatim general
longitude                             NULL
geocode_accuracy                      NULL
geocode_status                        NULL   # pending|resolved|manually_adjusted|failed|not_requested
geocoded_at                           NULL
location_source                       NULL   # manual_pin|google_places|google_geocoding|imported|unknown
permitted_check_in_radius_meters      NULL
needs_parking                         BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE  # new: parking need flag
property_category_id                  NULL
contact_name                          NULL
contact_phone                         NULL
contact_email                         NULL
postal_code                           NULL
access_instructions                   NULL
parking_instructions                  NULL   # shown when needs_parking = true
safety_instructions                   NULL
service_frequency                     NULL
active                                DEFAULT TRUE
internal_notes                        NULL
cleaning_duration_minutes             NULL   # billing
client_fixed_amount                   NULL
cleaner_pay_type                      NULL   # fixed|per_hour
cleaner_fixed_amount                  NULL
cleaner_rate_per_hour                 NULL
parking_fee                           NULL   # company→cleaner, relevant when needs_parking
created_by
updated_by
created_at
updated_at
deleted_at
```

`special_cleaning_requirements` removed — now a checklist concern, not a property column. If legacy data exists, migrate into a default checklist.

Use suitable decimal precision for latitude and longitude.

Recommended geocode status values:

- pending;
- resolved;
- manually_adjusted;
- failed;
- not_requested.

Recommended location source values:

- google_places;
- google_geocoding;
- manual_pin;
- imported;
- unknown.

## 7.2 Fast Create Workflow (Reimagined)

The fast-create property form MUST:

1. display `name` (required);
2. display `address` (required);
3. show Leaflet map with draggable pin (exact coordinate) + "Locate from address" (general coordinate via Nominatim/Google fallback) + "Use my location";
4. sync pin ↔ latitude/longitude inputs ↔ coordinate label bidirectionally; click map to place pin;
5. expose `needs_parking` toggle (when true, parking_instructions + parking_fee relevant);
6. hide all other fields behind collapsible "Optional details";
7. permit immediate save after name+address (pending geocode allowed);
8. enqueue geocode only if coordinates missing;
9. allow category, tags, radius, needs_parking, assignments to be added later.

When creating a task, provide:

- select existing property;
- create and save new property;
- use a one-time unsaved location for this task.

For a one-time task location:

- store the task location snapshot directly on the task;
- do not require a permanent property record;
- allow conversion into a saved property later.

## 7.3 Leaflet + Geocode Workflow (Reimagined)

Primary stack: Leaflet 1.9.x + OSM tiles + Nominatim. Google Places is optional fallback (server-side key, never exposed).

Web flow:

1. type address → optional Google autocomplete suggestions (if configured) otherwise plain;
2. click "Locate from address" → Nominatim search (or Google Place Details if suggestion chosen) → populate formatted_address + lat/lng;
3. Leaflet map: draggable marker, click-to-place, "Use my location" (Geolocation API);
4. lat/lng inputs editable, keep marker in sync;
5. save `location_source` (`google_places` | `google_geocoding` | `manual_pin` | `imported` | `unknown`), `geocode_status`, `geocoded_at`, `google_place_id` when available.

Server-side:

1. `GeocodeProperty` job tries Google geocode then Nominatim fallback;
2. scoring, best-result selection, accuracy stored;
3. retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts, 30s);
4. skip re-geocode if `geocode_hash(name|address)` unchanged unless manual retry.

Trigger re-geocode: address materially changed, retry requested, coords missing, status failed, import lacking coords. Do not block save.

## 7.4 Categories

Create dynamic property categories.

Category fields:

- name;
- slug;
- description;
- default check-in radius;
- default task type;
- default checklist;
- default manager;
- default team;
- default safety instructions;
- active;
- sort order.

A property may have zero or one primary category.

Category assignment MUST be editable later.

Changing category MUST NOT rewrite historical task snapshots.

## 7.5 Tags

Create reusable many-to-many property tags.

Tag fields:

- name;
- slug;
- description;
- active;
- optional display color;
- sort order.

Requirements:

- assign zero or more tags to a property;
- add tags during property creation;
- add tags later;
- remove tags later;
- bulk assign tags;
- bulk remove tags;
- merge duplicate tags;
- archive tags;
- search by one or more tags;
- filter by category and tags together.

Tag changes MUST NOT modify historical task records.

## 7.6 Property Assignment

A property may be assigned later to:

- manager;
- supervisor;
- cleaner;
- multiple cleaners;
- team;
- branch;
- service area.

Create a property assignment history table with:

- property ID;
- assignable type;
- assignable ID;
- assignment role;
- start date;
- end date;
- primary flag;
- assigned by;
- reason;
- created timestamp.

Support:

- permanent assignments;
- temporary assignments;
- date-limited assignments;
- primary and backup assignments;
- preferred cleaner assignments.

Do not require assignments during property creation.

## 7.7 Property Search

Implement indexed search and combined filtering.

Search fields:

- property name;
- address;
- formatted address;
- Google Place ID;
- contact name;
- contact phone;
- category;
- tags;
- assigned manager;
- assigned cleaner;
- team;
- branch;
- active status;
- last service date;
- next service date;
- GPS availability;
- geocode status.

Provide:

- autocomplete;
- recent properties;
- saved filters;
- map view;
- nearby-property search;
- unassigned-property filter;
- missing-coordinate filter;
- bulk selection;
- export.

---

# 8. Task Type and Checklist Module (Reimagined)

Task types MUST be dynamic and configurable without code changes.

Task type fields:

- name, slug, description, default estimated duration, default priority, default instructions, default checklist, before/after-photo requirements, minimum photo count, approval required, allowed assignee types, active, sort order.

Checklist templates own what was previously "property requirements". They MUST support:

- sections (e.g. Kitchen, Bathroom, Upon Arrival, Keys), ordered;
- ordered items within section;
- `item_type` ∈ `yes_no | pass_fail | text | numeric | photo`;
- `required` (must complete to finish task);
- `is_photo_required` — photo upload required to complete item;
- `is_comment_required` — text comment required to complete item;
- `issue_triggering` — flags incident flow;
- `sort_order`, `active`.

Tables: `checklist_templates` → `checklist_sections` → `checklist_items` (`label, item_type, required, is_photo_required, is_comment_required, issue_triggering, sort_order`).

**Checklist → Subtask flow (new):** When a checklist is selected during task creation, **each checklist item becomes a subtask** on the task:

- `task_subtasks` row: `task_id, title (= item label), section_name, sort_order, completed_at/null, completed_by/null`
- `task_checklist_snapshots` row: snapshot of item + `is_photo_required/is_comment_required` for immutable history (covers photo/comment gating in `POST /tasks/{task}/checklists/{id}/toggle`)
- `GET /admin/checklists/{id}/items` returns sections+items for preview on task-create page.

When a task is created, snapshot the task type and checklist so later template edits do not alter existing tasks/subtasks. Historical `property_requirements` table is dropped (migration `2026_08_22_reimagine_property_checklist`).

# 9. Task Module

## 9.1 Task Fields

Create tasks with fields equivalent to:

```text
id
uuid
reference_number
title
description
task_type_id
property_id                       NULL for one-time location
property_name_snapshot
address_snapshot
latitude_snapshot
longitude_snapshot
check_in_radius_snapshot
assigned_manager_id               NULL
scheduled_start_at
scheduled_end_at
estimated_duration_minutes        NULL
priority
status
recurrence_rule                   NULL
approval_required
accepted_at                       NULL
started_at                        NULL
completed_at                      NULL
submitted_at                      NULL
approved_at                       NULL
rejected_at                       NULL
cancelled_at                      NULL
created_by
updated_by
created_at
updated_at
deleted_at
```

A task may be assigned to:

- one cleaner;
- multiple cleaners;
- one team;
- a supervisor;
- another authorized staff type.

Use a dedicated task assignment table.

## 9.2 Task Status State Machine

Implement the following state flow:

```text
draft
  -> scheduled
  -> assigned
  -> accepted
  -> in_progress
  -> completed
  -> submitted_for_approval
  -> approved
```

Additional valid states:

```text
unassigned
declined
paused
delayed
unable_to_access
correction_requested
rejected
reopened
cancelled
```

Do not permit arbitrary status updates.

Implement explicit transition rules.

Every transition MUST create a task status history record with:

- previous status;
- new status;
- user;
- timestamp;
- remarks;
- device;
- latitude and longitude when relevant;
- source platform.

## 9.3 Task Creation

Task creation MUST support:

- select task type;
- select existing property;
- quick-create property;
- one-time location;
- description;
- reference images;
- date and time;
- expected duration;
- individual or team assignment;
- recurrence;
- notification rules;
- checklist overrides;
- photo requirements;
- approval requirement.

Validate:

- scheduling conflicts;
- employee availability;
- overlapping assignments;
- leave;
- required skills;
- travel-time warnings when enabled.

Warnings may be overridden by authorized users with a recorded reason.

## 9.4 Recurring Tasks

Support recurring task templates.

Store:

- recurrence rule;
- start date;
- optional end date;
- time;
- assigned property;
- default assignee;
- task type;
- checklist;
- notification timing.

Generate task instances ahead of time using a scheduled command.

Do not modify completed instances when the recurring template changes.

---

# 10. Calendar and Scheduling

Web calendar views:

- daily;
- weekly;
- monthly;
- personnel;
- team;
- property;
- manager.

Required features:

- drag-and-drop rescheduling;
- assignment from calendar;
- conflict warnings;
- filter by status, property, category, tags, employee, and task type;
- recurring task display;
- unscheduled task queue;
- leave and absence overlay;
- shift overlay.

Mobile calendar:

- personal day view;
- personal week view;
- upcoming task list;
- open task details;
- add task to device calendar where authorized.

External calendar synchronization is optional and must not delay the core implementation.

---

# 11. Shift and Attendance Module

## 11.1 Shifts

Shift fields:

- user;
- date;
- scheduled start;
- scheduled end;
- property or service area, nullable;
- manager;
- status;
- notes.

Shift states:

- scheduled;
- confirmed;
- in_progress;
- completed;
- missed;
- cancelled;
- absent.

## 11.2 Attendance Events

Attendance event types:

- clock_in;
- break_start;
- break_end;
- clock_out;
- manual_correction;
- supervisor_override.

Record:

- user;
- shift;
- event type;
- server timestamp;
- device timestamp;
- latitude;
- longitude;
- GPS accuracy;
- effective radius;
- property;
- distance from property;
- inside geofence;
- device ID;
- source;
- offline flag;
- synced timestamp;
- remarks.

## 11.3 Attendance Rules

Implement:

- late arrival detection;
- early departure detection;
- missed shift detection;
- overtime;
- total work duration;
- break duration;
- attendance correction request;
- supervisor approval or rejection;
- immutable original event preservation.

Manual corrections MUST create adjustment records rather than rewriting the original verified event.

---

# 12. GPS, Geofence, and Location Verification

## 12.1 Check-In Validation

For GPS check-in:

1. request current device location;
2. capture accuracy;
3. reject or warn when accuracy exceeds configured threshold;
4. calculate distance from task or property coordinates;
5. resolve effective permitted radius;
6. store distance and radius;
7. mark event inside or outside geofence;
8. follow organization policy:
   - accept;
   - accept with exception;
   - require manager override;
   - reject.

Use a reliable geodesic distance calculation.

## 12.2 Missing Coordinates

When a property lacks coordinates:

- do not crash;
- display that GPS verification is unavailable;
- attempt queued geocoding;
- allow manager-approved exception if policy permits;
- record the exception;
- prevent false claims that the location was verified.

## 12.3 Location Tracking Scope

Default behavior:

- record discrete GPS events at check-in, task start, task completion, and check-out;
- optionally record periodic location only during an active shift or task when organization policy enables it;
- never collect background location outside active work windows;
- display clear consent and permission state;
- retain only the required location history.

## 12.4 Spoofing and Integrity Signals

Record available integrity indicators:

- mock-location indicator where available;
- rooted or jailbroken device risk where available;
- impossible travel;
- device time difference;
- low GPS accuracy;
- repeated out-of-radius attempts;
- offline submission delay;
- manual pin usage.

Do not automatically accuse a user. Create a reviewable exception.

# 17. Laravel Web UI Requirements

Build the web application before Ionic.

Required web modules:

1. authentication;
2. dashboard;
3. personnel;
4. managers and cleaners;
5. teams;
6. properties;
7. property categories;
8. property tags;
9. property assignments;
10. task types;
11. checklist templates;
12. task creation;
13. task list;
14. task detail;
15. calendar;
16. shifts;
17. attendance;
18. approval queue;
19. GPS exceptions;
20. incidents;
21. notifications;
22. reports;
23. audit log;
24. settings.

## 17.1 Property Web Form (Reimagined — Mobile-Friendly)

Layout: mobile-first, single column ≤576px, stacked cards, 44px tap targets, collapsible optional section. Leaflet map is primary (not Google).

Default visible (above fold, no scroll needed on mobile):

- name (required);
- address (required) + "Locate from address" + "Use my location" buttons + autocomplete suggestions when configured;
- Leaflet map (360px desktop / 280px mobile, draggable pin, click-to-place, lat/lng inputs synced);
- needs_parking toggle + coordinate label;
- Save button.

Collapsed optional section:

- formatted_address, google_place_id (readonly when present);
- category, tags, check-in radius;
- contact name/phone/email, postal_code, service_frequency, active;
- access_instructions, parking_instructions (emphasized when needs_parking), safety_instructions, internal_notes;
- cleaning/billing block (duration H/M, client_fixed, cleaner pay type, parking_fee).

Must save without expanding optional section. Pin drag must update lat/lng instantly; Nominatim geocode must not block save.

## 17.2 Task Web Form (Reimagined)

Use high-density dual-panel (7/5 split desktop, stacked mobile) with section cards.

1. Property & Location (property select via Select2 + location snapshot drawer for one-time locations);
2. Schedule & Type (task_type, duration H/M, priority, hourly_rate, starts/ends);
3. People & Assignments (multi assignees, manager, team, approval_required toggle);
4. **Checklist → Subtasks** — checklist_template_id select + live preview (`GET /admin/checklists/{id}/items`) showing sections/items with photo/comment badges; hint: "each item becomes a subtask";
5. Financials & Parking (parking_fee default from property);
6. Recurrence (RRULE, collapsible);
7. review and create.

Autosave drafts where practical. When checklist selected, `CreateTask` creates `task_subtasks` + `task_checklist_snapshots` immutably.

# 20. Shared Visual Design System

Create:

```text
docs/design-tokens/tokens.json

## 24.4 End-to-End Critical Scenario

Automate this scenario:

1. Super Administrator creates a Manager.
2. Super Administrator creates a Cleaner.
3. Manager creates a property using only name and address.
4. Google coordinates resolve automatically.
5. Manager later assigns a category and tags.
6. Manager later assigns the property to the Cleaner.
7. Manager creates and schedules a task.
8. Cleaner receives the task.
9. Cleaner checks in within the radius.
10. Cleaner starts the task.
11. Cleaner completes checklist items.
12. Cleaner captures before and after images.
13. Cleaner adds remarks.
14. Cleaner checks out.
15. Cleaner submits for approval.
16. Manager reviews and approves.
17. Reports and audit logs reflect the full workflow.

Also test the same flow when:

- Google geocoding fails;
- the device is offline;
- GPS is outside the radius;
- a required image is missing;
- the Manager requests correction.

# 29. Final Build Directive

Build a production-oriented internal cleaning workforce platform.

The first usable release MUST be the Laravel web application.

The Laravel codebase MUST contain both:

- the web administration and operational interface;
- the versioned API consumed by Ionic.

The Ionic application MUST be implemented after the web workflows and API contracts are stable.

Property entry MUST remain fast:

- only name and address are mandatory;
- Google must automatically resolve the best available coordinates;
- all additional property details must remain optional;
- permitted check-in radius must be nullable and resolved through configuration fallback;
- categories, tags, and personnel assignments must be assignable later;
- property search must remain efficient as data volume grows.

Do not implement any customer-facing feature.
